# AI Development Workflow

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation and documentation for the *Understanding the AI Development Workflow* assignment from the *AI for Software Engineering* course at PLP Academy. The project applies the AI development workflow to two scenarios:

1. **Hypothetical Problem**: Predicting student dropout rates in a university to facilitate early interventions.
2. **Case Study**: Predicting patient readmission risk within 30 days of discharge for a hospital system.

The repository includes Python scripts for data preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and deployment, along with a Jupyter notebook for exploratory data analysis. All code is well-commented, modular, and organized to meet the assignment’s requirements, including technical accuracy, ethical considerations, and critical analysis of the workflow.

Developed by [Your Group Name or Individual Names] as a peer group effort over 7 days, this project is accompanied by a PDF report (shared in the PLP Academy Community) that details responses to the assignment’s questions, including a flowchart of the AI development workflow.
